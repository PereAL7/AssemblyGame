#AssemblyGame
A game developed in Motorola 68K's assembly language as a university project.

First of all, I'm not the only creator of this. Mateo Javier Ramón Román is the cocreator besides me.

This project was fully developed using Easy68K, a program which emulates a Motorola 68K processor.
Both The Legend of Zelda and The Binding of Isaac were clear inspirations when the game development started.
