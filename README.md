# AssemblyGame
First of all, I'm not the only creator of this. Mateo Javier Ramón Román is the cocreator besides me.
Basically this is a game developed in Motorola 68K's assembly language as a university project.
This was an assigment to test our skills dealing with I/O operations using assembly and our hability to
adapt to the hardware and programming limitations of an older CPU.

# Development and inspirations
This project was fully developed using Easy68K, a program which emulates a Motorola 68K processor.
Both The Legend of Zelda and The Binding of Isaac were clear inspirations when the game development started as
their moving and fighting mechanics were relativelly easy to translate and adapt to an efficient "character controller".

# Future
Right now neither me nor my partner have decided to continue further development despite the knowledge of som possible upgrades

I want to end this README thanking our teacher. He gave us (the students) a really good template to start this project and inspired us by showing examples of what can be done with enough wit a determination.
